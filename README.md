# etl-of-down-30-stocks-data

The focus of this ETL Project lies on the Dow 30 stocks. The Dow 30 is a stock market index that
measures the stock performance of 30 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the US. This
index has been chosen due to the fact that it is one of the most observed indicators for stock market
performance, as well as a good indicator of the performance of the U.S. economy.
Data on the Dow 30 stocks is available from various websites such as CNBC.com, Yahoo Finance
and also from Dividend.com, as well as from other sources. The goal of this project was to retrieve
data on the Dow 30 stocks, i.e. on the price, on the absolute change, on the percentage change, the
daily low and high, as well as on the previous close. Furthermore, data on the ESG ratings1 of the
Dow 30 stocks, as well as the Dividends from the Dow 30 stocks was aimed to attain.
Note: Since this project scraped real time data from stock prices, the data retrieved may change
across time. The time of scraping of this project was done on May 26th 2020, 06:18pm PST.
